## Intro
Hello everyone! In my third semester of software engineering, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting projects - a group project and an individual project.

For the group project, I worked with a team of software students to design and develop a software application that addressed a real-world problem. The project required us to collaborate effectively, share responsibilities, and communicate efficiently. I learned a lot about teamwork, project management, how to deliver software in a team environment and much more.

For the individual project, I had the opportunity to work with a student and choose a topic and scope of the project. This allowed us to explore our shared interests. Together, we worked to design, develop, test the software and much more.

further down in this document u can find links to what i have been working on in semester 3. In the individuel project i worked together with Arthur Brouwers, and in the group project i worked together with Arthur Brouwers, Rik Fieret, Casper van den Dijk, Cedric Berden.
