## Personal Learning Outcome Rating
This is a personal  reflection on the learning outcomes for this semester.
Under here is a table where I give myself a rating on each of the learning outcomes and a clarification.

|Learning Outcome|Rating|Clarification|
|:---------------|:-----|:--------|
|Web Application|Advanced|**Userfriendly**: <br/>To make our application as userfriendly as possible we've looked at a lot of other applications to see how they manage their UX. Another thing we did to improve user friendliness was getting feedback from other people. <br/> <br/> **Fullstack**:<br/> We've designed and built our application with a React front-end, and 2 back-end services (Userpreferences-API and Integrations-API), our project uses external api's and services from google for authentication, and open weather map and bron fontys for external data|
|Software Quality|Proficient|**Tooling and Methodology**:<br/> In the individual project we've made Unit tests and Integration tests, to test new features from the userstories. <br/> To apply static code analysis we use SonarCloud, which can detect bugs, code smells and more.<br/> We apply code reviews which are required before branches can be merged into main. 
|Agile Method|Proficient|In the grou project we use Scrum to work together as a team on our project. Over this semester we've applied things like, sprints, sprint reviews, daily standups, retrospectives, backlogs, and Jira as our scrum tooling. <br/> As a team we've worked together on creating userstories, and refining them so we can balance our workload in a sprint to bring the product to the Product Owners.|
|CI/CD|Advanced|We've implemented a complete CI/CD, which automatically builds and tests unit and integration tests when new commits are pushed to a branch. When branches are merged into main, a docker image will be created and sent to Dockerhub. Additionally, we've made a research about the deployment of our application, you can [find it here](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/blob/main/ResearchDocuments.md)|
|Cultural differences and ethics|Proficient|**Recognize**: <br/> During this semester I have learned to recognize the different cultural values and expections from our product owners, and within our own group. <br/><br/> **Take into account**: <br/> I have learned to better understand the cultural values from people within my team, teachers and product owners. Being able to understand these values more, allows for better collaboration and communication. <br/><br/> **Ethics**: <br/>I've adressed the issue of ethics within programming, and how ethical guidelines like the ACM can help people make better ethical decisions.|
|Requirements and design|Proficient|**Analyze Requirements**: <br/> We've analyzed requirements from the product owners and turned them into user stories. <br/><br/>**Elaborate designs**: <br/> The architectual designs made for the IP and GP are documented and explained on the documentation repositories. UI designs were made to help with building a good UI/UX, and getting feedback from stakeholders before implementing new features. <br/><br/>**Validate**: To validate the user stories we completed, we've applied user acceptance testing. And we used feedback from stakeholders and teachers to validate and improve our product. |
|Business process|Proficient|**Analyze and descripe business processes**: <br/> I've made a Business Process Model and Notation about the business flow of our Group Project.|
