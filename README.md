# Portfolio
*By Matthijs Dolmans*

## Intro
Hello everyone! In my third semester of software engineering, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting projects - a group project and an individual project.

For the group project, I worked with a team of software students to design and develop a software application that addressed a real-world problem. The project required us to collaborate effectively, share responsibilities, and communicate efficiently. I learned a lot about teamwork, project management, how to deliver software in a team environment and much more.

For the individual project, I had the opportunity to work with a student and choose a topic and scope of the project. This allowed us to explore our shared interests. Together, we worked to design, develop, test the software and much more.

further down in this document u can find links to what i have been working on in semester 3. In the individuel project i worked together with Arthur Brouwers, and in the group project i worked together with Arthur Brouwers, Rik Fieret, Casper van den Dijk, Cedric Berden.

## Personal Learning Outcome Rating
This is a personal  reflection on the learning outcomes for this semester.
Under here is a table where I give myself a rating on each of the learning outcomes and a clarification.

|Learning Outcome|Rating|Clarification|
|:---------------|:-----|:--------|
|Web Application| <br/>| In my individual project i have made use of a javascript front-end using the framework vue3[front end](https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Front-end). For the backend we did some research and came to the conclusion to use java as backend language to retrieve data from our mysql database we use an orm framework called jpa [backend](https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/API) to find out why i have chosen these languages/ frameworks [research back-end/front-end](https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Documentation/blob/main/ResearchDocuments.md)
|Software Quality|<br/> | In my individual project I made use of an static code analysis sonarcloud. Sonarcloud had a new feature where it would automatically do a scan on a pull request to main since my project was setup to run the tests on pull request on main this worked perfectly together so it would check the code analysis and the tests before merging into the main. In the individual project we have written some front-end / integration tests to check if the program works as expected. To make sure that not everyone can access the api calls we have integrated auth0 to secure our api call [research auth0/oauth2.0](https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Documentation/blob/main/ResearchDocuments/Auth0Research.md)
|Agile Method| Proficient | In our groupproject we always started off with a stand up where we talked about what we are gonna do for that day. After lunch break we would come together to tell each other what has been done or what the issues are so if needed someone could help. After every sprint we did a retrospective and made a new sprint planning, we did this using jira. We would take tasks from our backlog then put them into the sprint planning and give them storie points to estimate how much time was needed for it. Since I worked together on my individual project Agile also came back here. We used the same principles as descriped before standups/sprint planning/retrospective) [group project retrospective](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Sprint/AllSprints.md) and [individual project retrospective](https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Documentation/blob/main/Sprint%20planning%20-%20retrospective.md)
|CI/CD| Proficient | In my individual project I have written a ci/cd pipeline that checks all the unit/integration tests on a pull request to main and if they fail u can not merge into main this is done by branch protection rules. if the tests succeeds it goes into the docker image build pipeline that creates the image and uploads it to dockerhub. 
|Cultural differences and ethics|Proficient| For our group project we have looked into code of ethics and written a document about how we experienced these ethics in our own project [ethics document](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Ethics.md).
|Requirements and design||
|Business process||
|professional| Proficient | In the individual project we have kept our stakeholder up to date with what we wanted to achieve every sprint and how we reflected on the previous sprint and took his feedback into account while planning the next sprint. I have writted 3 research documents together with [arthur](https://github.com/orgs/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/people/Arthur-Brouwers) about ci/cd and [auth0/oauth2.0](https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Documentation/blob/main/ResearchDocuments/Auth0Research.md) and as last i have documented the process of how these 18 weeks went in my portfolio.
